# PyBer_Analysis

---
## Project Overview 

Using Python and Pandas, and data provided by the ride sharing company PyBers, I created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Using Pandas and Matplotlib, I then created a graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type. 

Using the Pandas groupby() function with the count() and sum() methods on PyBer DataFrame columns, get the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total fares for each city type. Then, calculate the average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each city type. 

Resources  - Software: Python 3.9.12, matplotlib 3.5.2

## Summary 

The analysis of the data shows that: 
  - There were 306,055 trips in the dataset. 

  - The trips were split between demographic areas based on density
    - Urban
    - Suburban
    - Rural  
    
  - Data requested was a sum of total rides, total drivers, total fares, in addition to the average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge we faced the task of using Python to import text data and 
perform some simple analysis on that data. Election data from the 2018 General 
Election for Colorado's 1st Congressional District was provided in a comma-
delineated text file.

The data was processed to find the total vote counts and percentage of the 
vote for each candidate. Additionally, we were asked to represent the largest 
voting county in the district.

## Election-Audit Summary: 

With our elections coming under the most intense scrutiny in history, it is 
more important than ever that elections officials provide as much transparency
as possible. To that end, PSyber PSamurais proposes to provide full-service  
auditing for your elections office.

With our not very proprietary but very flexible Python-based analysis we can
easily pull the information you want to see from very large datasets like vote
records. 

With access to the full vote record of each ballot, we are able to 
provide analysis on undervotes, or instances where voters chose to vote in one 
race but not another. We would also be able to see unusual voting patterns, such 
as large blocks of votes for the same candidate being dumped into the data at the 
same time. 

Psyber PSamurais is your one-stop shop for both creating doubt, and putting those 
doubts at ease in our modern election cycle!
